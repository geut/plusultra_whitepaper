# Technical Draft: A platform to augment web applications with multimodal interactions @ Geut LABS

Here we are introducing a novel platform that expands, what we called, the common set of interactions on web applications. Further more, this platform not only helps to increase this set, but also adds multimodal interactions capabilities to web applications. The way the multimodal interaction is supported is based on a different approach introduced here as a distributed fusion system.
